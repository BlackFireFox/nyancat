[Nyan cat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QH2-TGUlwu4) ASCII animation in C for
terminal with music. Have fun.

# Background

The cross-plattform compatible C program compiles down to a single file
including the animation, music and libraries. It is mainly one function with a
loop that draws a frame, sleeps and clears the area. No extra libraries are
needed to display it. The music is composed using
[MilkyTracker](http://milkytracker.org/?about), an open-source multi-plattform
clone of the old and famous
[Fasttracker II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Tracker).
[MikMod](http://mikmod.raphnet.net/) library is use for playback of the module,
which is almost the only module playing library freely available with complete
source code and cross-plattform compatibility (Linux, Mac, BSD, Windows). Many
other libraries like [BassMod](http://www.un4seen.com/bassmod.html),
[Mini FMOD](http://www.fmod.org/index.php/download#FMODMini),
[Î¼FMOD](http://ufmod.sourceforge.net/), or
[ModPlug Plugin](http://www.roncli.com/modplug/download.asp?FileID=7) are either
not open source, or don't support all major plattforms.
